                <h1>What is CVD?</h1>
                The study programme, "Computational Visualistics and Design" aims to generate a line of engineers with design competence,
                who specialise in the computer-assisted, multi-dimensional generation of images for complex applications in industry and
                medicine, in sports, or in creative fields. The study course combines the teaching of engineering expertise,
                particularly from the field of computer sciences, with the acquisition of artistic-creative skills.
                In the professional world, this combined knowledge is required to simulate objects, spaces and processes and to integrate
                them into virtual environments, with the support of high-performance computers and specialist software. On this basis,
                industrial prototypes, for example, can be tested for their functionality, illnesses can be diagnosed and research can be
                carried out on customer behaviour. In the creative fields, computational visualistics are applied in the post-production
                phase of cinema and television films, as well as in producing computer games and designing room interiors,
                buildings and lighting concepts.
